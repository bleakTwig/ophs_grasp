In this paper, two different algorithms to solve the orienteering problem with hotel selection (OPHS), an extension of the orienteering problem (OP), are explained and their results are compared. Other algorithms for solving similar problems, like the original OP, the Team-OP (TOP) or the travelling salesman problem with hotel selection (TSPHS) are shortly explained and compared as well. What modifications would need to be made to these algorithms to produce solutions for the OPHS are looked at as well. The OPHS is also extensively defined and a mathematical model is given, and important notes for future developments on the problem are given. After this, a representation for the problem is presented, and a Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedure algorithm is described and tested as a way to find solutions for the problem.
